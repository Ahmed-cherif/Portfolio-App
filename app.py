    Description: 

    During my summer internship, I worked on a project aimed at enhancing the 
    performance of the company's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. 
    My primary role involved developing an artificial intelligence 
    module to improve text recognition accuracy in scanned documents. 
    Additionally, I created an Excel-based database to train and evaluate the model, 
    resulting in a significant reduction in recognition errors.
    Also, I developed a Flask-based microservice to automatically extract 
    information from CVs. 
    The project aimed to streamline and expedite the recruitment process by 
    extracting data.
    In summary, I focused on improving the OCR system's performance and developed 
    a microservice to extract information from CVs, enhancing efficiency in the 
    recruitment process.

- ‚ñ∫ Designed and developed an artificial intelligence module using Flask to enhance the OCR system's performance.
- ‚ñ∫ Utilized the XGBoost algorithm and XMLRegressor for optimizing text recognition accuracy.
- ‚ñ∫ Gathered and prepared relevant data from scanned documents for model training.
- ‚ñ∫ Created and managed an Excel-based database for model training and evaluation.
- ‚ñ∫ Conducted rigorous testing to assess the module's performance and accuracy.
- ‚ñ∫ Thoroughly documented the implemented methods and achieved results.
- ‚ñ∫ Designed and developed a Flask microservice for extracting information from CVs.
- ‚ñ∫ Extracted structured data from CV documents in various formats.
