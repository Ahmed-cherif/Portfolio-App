    I have developed an advanced real-time lip-reading system that translates visual speech cues into audible speech. This system processes
live video feeds to generate precise text predictions, which are then synthesized into speech, enhancing communication for individuals.

- ‚ñ∫Developed a novel real-time lip-reading system using CTC, TimeDistributed, 3DCNN and Bi-LSTM networks.
- ‚ñ∫Achieved high accuracy with a Character Error Rate (CER) of 8.15% and Character Accuracy (CA) of 91.85% on the GRID dataset.
- ‚ñ∫Implemented a deployment strategy using Flask to enable real-time lip reading through a web application.
- ‚ñ∫Achieved text predictions and synthesized speech by normalizing image data, using CTC decoding, correcting text with TextBlob.
- ‚ñ∫Integrated TensorFlow and MediaPipe to capture and process lip movements.
- ‚ñ∫Constructed the DATAV1 dataset with more than 600 files for initial model training and evaluation.
- ‚ñ∫Conducted a comprehensive analysis of deep learning model architectures for lip reading using the DATAV1 dataset.
- ‚ñ∫Explored and evaluated multiple architectures like ResBlock3D, Conv3D, Conv2D, TimeDistributed, attention mechanism, and LSTM.
- ‚ñ∫Identified the optimal architecture achieving a peak validation accuracy of 98.18%.
- ‚ñ∫Contributed insights into effective model selection for accurate lip-reading performance.
- ‚ñ∫Constructed the DataV2 dataset with more than 4000 files for enhanced model training and evaluation.
- ‚ñ∫ Designed a new lip-reading model architecture incorporating 3D CNN, Bi-LSTM, TimeDistributed, and SoftMax layers.
- ‚ñ∫ Developed a real-time lip-reading application with a video interface displaying synchronized subtitles and predictions.
- ‚ñ∫ Implemented a chatbot using Voice flow and trained it with GPT-3.5 for user interaction and assistance
- ‚ñ∫ Designed and implemented a Video Metting Page
- ‚ñ∫ converting text to speech with Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

    Description: 

    During my summer internship, I worked on a project aimed at enhancing the 
    performance of the company's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. 
    My primary role involved developing an artificial intelligence 
    module to improve text recognition accuracy in scanned documents. 
    Additionally, I created an Excel-based database to train and evaluate the model, 
    resulting in a significant reduction in recognition errors.
    Also, I developed a Flask-based microservice to automatically extract 
    information from CVs. 
    The project aimed to streamline and expedite the recruitment process by 
    extracting data.
    In summary, I focused on improving the OCR system's performance and developed 
    a microservice to extract information from CVs, enhancing efficiency in the 
    recruitment process.

- ‚ñ∫ Designed and developed an artificial intelligence module using Flask to enhance the OCR system's performance.
- ‚ñ∫ Utilized the XGBoost algorithm and XMLRegressor for optimizing text recognition accuracy.
- ‚ñ∫ Gathered and prepared relevant data from scanned documents for model training.
- ‚ñ∫ Created and managed an Excel-based database for model training and evaluation.
- ‚ñ∫ Conducted rigorous testing to assess the module's performance and accuracy.
- ‚ñ∫ Thoroughly documented the implemented methods and achieved results.
- ‚ñ∫ Designed and developed a Flask microservice for extracting information from CVs.
- ‚ñ∫ Extracted structured data from CV documents in various formats.
